# Metrics Collector Midi Microservice

This is a microservice that subscribes to a queue or pubsub channel hosted on 

* Redis 
* RabbitMQ
* Apache Kafka 

and writes the data to a Midi device to turn data into music.

This service is designed to be paired with the *Metrics Collector Microservice* which sends web traffic data to a Redis, RabbitMQ or Kafka queue or pubsub channel. Other Microservices can listen to the data arriving on those channels, services such as the *Metrics Collector Storage Microservice* which can store data in Cloudant, MongoDB or ElasticSearch. This microservice turns the arriving data into music by posting notes to a virtual MIDI device.

## Installation

Clone this repository and then run

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Set your environment variables and start up the app e.g.

```
export QUEUE_TYPE=redis_queue
node app.js
```

Run GarageBand on the same machine and create a new virtual instrument and as data arrives on your channel, music will start to play.

## What is it doing?

When this microservice runs it creates a virtual 'MIDI out' port and as data arrives on the selected queue or PubSub channel, the service writes a note to the MIDI channel where the note depends on

* a hash of the incoming data - determines the pitch and octave
* a randomly chosen chord (the chord changes every 12 seconds)
* a randomly selected note length


## Environment variables
